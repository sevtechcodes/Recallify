A personal memory recording web app

**Project Description:**
Recallify is a platform designed to improve memory recall. It serves as a personal memory recording web application where users can preserve videos, voice recordings, images, and notes. The primary aim is to immortalize cherished moments for future recollection.

## MVP - Key Features
Media Upload: Video, picture, and voice recording upload functionality.
Note Taking: Ability to write and save text notes.
Storage: Use of local and Firebase storage for media.

With Recallyfy, users can create, read, edit, and delete memories effortlessly:
*Create Memory:* Users could easily capture new memories by uploading videos, pictures, or recording voice notes directly within the app.
*Read Memory:* Each memory was presented in a visually appealing format, allowing users to revisit their captured moments with ease. Whether browsing through a photo, playing back a video, or reading through notes, Recallify* ensured a seamless and immersive experience.
*Edit Memory:* Recognizing the impermanence of memory, I designed Recallify to be flexible. Users could edit details of their memories â€“ adding captions, updating descriptions, or even attaching additional media to enrich the story.
*Delete Memory:* Recallify allowed users to delete memories they no longer wished to keep, ensuring they could curate their digital archive according to their preferences.
